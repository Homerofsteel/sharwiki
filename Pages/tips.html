<h2 class="page-title">Tips for Speedrunning SHAR</h2>
<ul class="tips-list">
    <li>Don't run while pressing a button like in 1-4, it will cause weird things.</li>
    <li>Despawn traffic with caution.</li>
    <li>Don't rush through your menuing.</li>
    <li>Don't risk getting hit and run for one coin if you're not in a good situation.</li>
    <li>Focus on your driving skills first before implementing risky strategies that only save 2 seconds.</li>
    <li>Learn a proper coin route and backup coins.</li>
    <li>Don't bother resetting for small time losses in early game, no-reset runs are very useful.</li>
    <li>Practice and analyze what went wrong during your session to improve.</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to learn Homer 2 OOB when starting; there are very simple ones.</li>
    <li>If you struggle with a category PB, try playing another one to improve your skills and knowledge.</li>
    <li>Doing ILs is also a great way to improve at shar.</li>
    <li>Don't always hold accelerate; learn when to brake for better speed. Some turns make your car go crazy if you only accelerate.</li>
    <li>Don't play on high FPS if you can't consistently get the hard unique tricks.</li>
    <li>Learn backup strategies for missions because anything can happen in this game.</li>
    <li>Ensure your settings are correct; an invalid run could be the result of bad settings.</li>
    <li>Don't rush when buying clothes, especially Apu-American!!!</li>
    <li>Be aware of common crashes to avoid them.</li>
    <li>If your hit-and-run meter is high and your coins are low, you can try to get hit-and-run in a good place to reset it.</li>
    <li>Hitting solid objects like poles or trees will slow you down; try to hit them with the side of your car.</li>
    <li>If your car starts flying in a wrong direction, don't be afraid to press the reset button to respawn on the road.</li>
    <li>In most missions, the closer you are to NPC cars, the faster they'll go. But sometimes, slow down to avoid them from getting stuck in dumps or getting a two-cycle.</li>
    <li>Find your preferred camera for driving.</li>
