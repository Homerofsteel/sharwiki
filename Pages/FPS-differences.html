          <p class="paragraphe"> The Simpsons Hit Run runs natively in 30fps on ps2, 60fps on Gamecube and Xbox and at unlimited fps on PC. These differents fps change drastically the gameplay. So when you start running this game the choice of your fps is very important.<br>
        On this page you'll find a recap of main differences between most common fps used in the main categories.<br>
    We can divide the fps into 3 ranges:<br><br>
<strong>Low fps (60-100):</strong> These fps are the most common ones at a beginner level for one main reason which is his consistency. Low fps are often considered to be slower than high fps at top level but it would help you getting more runs to the end.<br>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong> Easier cutscenes skips, easier Homer 2 OOBs, faster armored truck destruction
    <strong>Negative Points:</strong>No boat jump(harder coin route), slower early game because of no boosts.<br>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Most common low fps played is 60fps by some players are playing on 46 or 100 but there is no really advantages.<br><br>
<strong>Middle fps(100-150):</strong> These fps are by far the less common fps used because they don't benefit from low fps advantages and neither from high fps advantages.<br>
<strong>Advantages:</strong>Provide some boosts while having easy cutscenes skips.<br>
<strong>Negative Points:</strong> No bridge clip possible, no 7-2 gravayard jump OOB(it's possible on 150fps but harder than on high fps)<br><br>
