<h3 class="page-title">Ebrake Boosting</h3>
<p class="paragraphe"><strong>Description: </strong> Ebrake boosting is a little mechanic which let you have a bigger acceleration from a starting point. This can be used in a lot of situations.<br><br>
<strong>Where to perform it? (not exhaustive): </strong>3-3 fast drops, 5-7 fast curator, 6-5 fast Skinner, 7-2 bridge clip, 7-2 graveyard jump,  7-4 school jump, 7-5 powerplant climb, 7-6 bridge clip, 7-6 yolo strat<br><br>
<strong>How to perform it: </strong>Doing an ebrake boost is very simple you'll need to know if you can press your accelerate button, your brake/reverse button and your ebrake button at the same time because sometimes the game can't handle the layout used for whatever reason. Even if you don't have to brake for every ebrake boost instance it can be useful in some cases because adding brake makes an ebrake boost while not moving and helps a lot for building a full ebrake boost.<br><br>
<strong>Warning: </strong>-Don't hold accelerate and ebrake only for more than like 3 seconds or your ebrake boost will be canceled.<br>
-Make sure to be at full stop to start an ebrake boost to make sure it will work.</p>
