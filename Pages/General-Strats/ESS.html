<h3 class="page-title">Enter Skip Storage</h3>
<p class="paragraphe"><strong>Description: </strong> Enter Skip Storage (also known as ESS) is a trick done throughout the run which allows you to skip most of camera pan-ins.<br><br>
<strong>How to perform it: </strong>You need to call a car from a phonebooth and during the camera pan-in you have to press your change camera button. Then when you warp you'll see "[Enter] skip" at the bottom of your screen it means that ESS works, now you just have to press your enter button and you'll skip the camera pan-in.<br><br>
<strong>Warning: </strong>-You can't press enter after you get ess unless you are trying to skip a dialogue so don't mash your enter button.<br>
-Your enter button can't be assigned to other than the enter action so check your options<br><br>
There's a lot of camera pan-in which can be skipped but their timesaves vary depending on the length of the camera pan-in. Here's the length of every camera pan-in: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1thJwcCb58VwNRJwQRT53kzmyF3lCoyLNQiPihFckHvw/edit#gid=0">link</a><br>
